# cache

**cache** is a time aware LRU cache.

I've been writing simplified, specialized versions of these caches for a lot of
projects over the years, with a goroutine to periodically purge items, so I
thought I'd just put together a more generalized version I can use. 

Please see the [documentation for more info.](https://godoc.org/github.com/rselbach/cache)

Very much a work in progress.
